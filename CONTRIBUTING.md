# Contributing to Neo-CMS

Thanks for the interest. Neo-CMS is intentionally small and focused, so contributions should keep the scope narrow and the workflow simple.

## Project goals

- Keep the CMS tiny and easy to understand
- Use flat files in `content/` as the source of truth
- Stay Neocities-first and beginner-friendly

## Non-goals

- Plugin systems, themes marketplaces, or complex extensibility
- Multi-user workflows or permissions
- Advanced content modeling, databases, or build pipelines
- Turning this into a full-featured CMS

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a branch.
2. Keep changes minimal and in line with the goals above.
3. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots if the UI changes.

## Expectations

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Avoid adding dependencies unless essential.
- If a feature adds complexity or moves toward a full CMS, it likely will not be accepted.

If you are unsure about a change, open an issue first and describe the idea.
