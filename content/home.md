# Welcome

Hey, I'm CrowderSoup -- a software developer, dad of two, and lover of the open web. This site is a small example of what you can build with Neo-CMS: lightweight, hand-made, and easy to remix.

## On this site

- Example pages that show how Neo-CMS can be organized.
- A few placeholder sections you can personalize.
- Links you can swap for your own.

If you're into the retro web, pull up a chair and explore -- then make it yours.
