# Gardn for the handmade web

Gardn is a publishing layer for people who want a living site, not a feed prison. It gives your personal website a planted timeline: posts, harvests, and blog-roll moments that stay yours.

## Why people pick Gardn

- **IndieWeb-first:** your domain, your files, your style.
- **Embeddable by design:** drop in Gardn blocks and keep your existing layout.
- **Human tempo:** cultivate updates over time instead of chasing algorithm spikes.
- **Actually cozy:** minimal setup, no heavy framework lock-in.
