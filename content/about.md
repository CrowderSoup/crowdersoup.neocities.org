# About

I'm a software developer who likes building small, durable things on the web. This page is a lightweight example of how a personal bio could look in Neo-CMS.

## Things I enjoy

- Tiny tools that do one job well.
- Open standards and the IndieWeb.
- Clean, readable UI with a little personality.
- Learning in public and sharing what sticks.

If you want to say hi, check the rel="me" links in the sidebar -- or replace them with your own.
